# Adaboost

In recent years, boosting algorithms gained massive popularity in data science or machine learning competitions. Most of the winners of these competitions use boosting algorithms to achieve high accuracy. These Data science competitions provide the global platform for learning, exploring and providing solutions for various business and government problems. Boosting algorithms combine multiple low accuracy(or weak) models to create a high accuracy(or strong) models. It can be utilized in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, and sales. Boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are widely used machine learning algorithm to win the data science competitions. In this tutorial, you are going to learn the AdaBoost ensemble boosting algorithm, and the following topics will be covered
